# Password Generator

## Purpose
A website that allows the user to create a randomly generated password based on specific conditions (e.g. if they want Uppercase letters or special characters etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria
- When you click the "generate password" button you are greeted with a sequence of prompts
- The prompts need to include the following:
    - password length
    - uppercase letters?
    - lowercase letters?
    - numerical values?
    - special characters?
- If the password length isn't between 8 and 128 characters, prompt the length again.
- If the user didn't select at least one of the characters, reset the prompt sequence.
- When all the prompts are answered and they meet the above two criteria, the password is generated in the box.
